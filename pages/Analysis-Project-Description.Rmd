## Analysis Project Overview

During the semester, you will carry out an independent research and analysis project, using the skills we learn in this class. 
The purpose of the **Analysis Project** is for you to gain independent applied research experience. 
You are expected to apply the data analysis skills we learn in class to a real-world data set (ideally one related to your thesis or capstone research interests).
The project represents 30% of your grade, but is broken up into several components. 

**Guidelines and Requirements**

* Your analysis project should be submitted in both \*.Rmd and \*.docx format on the course Blackboard page
* Your write up should include the following sections
    * **Introduction** (approx. 250 - 500 words) - an overview of the data set you are using in your analysis. If you generated the data yourself, describe how you collected these data. If you are using data from another person's or group's project, describe why and how these data were collected by that individual or group.
    * **Research Question** (approx. 250 - 500 words) - describe your research question that you are trying to answer with these data. Why is this question important in a broader context (i.e., with respect to environmental science in general).
    * **Statistical Analysis** (approx. 500 - 750 words) - describe the analysis you are using to answer your question. Why is this the most appropriate analysis for your data and question? What assumptions are there in this analysis? Do you data meet these assumptions? If not, how much of an influence might these violations have on the interpretation of your results? Are there any other studies that have used a similar analysis to answer a similar question? 
    * **Results** (approx. 500 - 750 words) - provide a description and interpretation of your results.
* You should include any and all **in text** citations and a **works cited** section to support your description of your data, question, analysis choice, and results interpretation.
* **Figures and Tables** - you should include any and all figures and tables that support your analysis. **Each figure and table should have it's own caption that stands alone from the paper in *briefly* describing what information the figure/table is meant to convey.**


### Additional Points:

* Your analysis must include a **hypothesis testing** approach covered in the class, *unless* you have discussed an alternative with Prof. Aiello-Lammens.
* Your narrative must be well written, and poor written communication will be penalized.
* You must submit both an Rmd file and a Word file of the final product. The Word file **MUST** be a product of knitting the Rmd file.

### Important Dates:

* Wednesday, March 25 - Analysis project proposal due
    * The proposal is a short document expressing your interests and identifying potential data sets to work with. It will help me to guide you to resources that will be useful for your project.
* Wednesday, April 15 - Project update due
    * Your project update should include a description of the data set you will analyze, along with summary stats and figures related to these data.
* Wednesday, April 29 - Draft project due
    * Your draft should inlcude your Introduction and Research Question sections, as well as *at minimum* basic descriptions of your data and ideas for your analysis. 
* Wednesday, May 13 - Analysis project DUE
