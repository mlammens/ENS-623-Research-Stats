## Important COVID Information

**REMOTE LEARNING: The first two weeks of classes will be conducted remotely, through Sunday, February 6.** Some programs with necessary in-person components will continue in-person, and clinical experiences and other off-site activities may continue, depending on the procedures at the sponsoring institution.
We will meet on Zoom at our usual class time in the first two weeks of the semester.
Zoom login links are available through the Classes course page.

**COVID-19 VACCINE BOOSTER: Anyone coming to a Pace campus will be required to be both vaccinated and boosted once they are eligible** (subject to approved medical and religious exemptions).
You must upload your booster record to the [Confidential Patient Portal](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr20.rs6.net%2Ftn.jsp%3Ff%3D001qEL8jmgOBNe4z7m-rnAQmUmRbZMP4GWaiOkzbg22tE0RCmW7VKQWsiFMEjN97IQLBiR-Or0Wyp4a4OUBB948wS53m2AQGoF36-LtC5FUF8QlL-Ezj6zhqjUuuXFfDJf-qI5NI8boGX8tDjIXj9sYCl1QubkINZH_%26c%3DLw8ogqhRR_f1uvUuWeVqfuTf_tlYmy0_1XqWtPIg06_L4x6R-czmug%3D%3D%26ch%3DNRxG4cshf4gacnrl3L0u6dVCYwq9ab871fonGbCMH5j2RLEzYauaLA%3D%3D&data=04%7C01%7C%7C83d98223a5264ef566a508d9d45ee7b3%7C0799c53eca9a49e88901064a6412a41d%7C0%7C0%7C637774326342025604%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=jMEzTk61953uaUCst3TcVNV1LW1wkhiXvKi0lAE1iA0%3D&reserved=0).
To continue to access campus, you must upload a record of your booster within 30 days of when you become eligible.

**MASKING:** Omicron is especially transmissible.
While it seems to cause less severe illness than previous variants in those who are vaccinated and boosted, you can still be a vector of spread even if asymptomatic or with mild symptoms.
The best way to protect yourself and your community is to continue wearing high-quality, well-fitting masks, such as a KN95 mask or a double mask, when you are in a public place.
Masks will remain a requirement on Pace campuses.

More information is available on the [Return to Campus](https://www.pace.edu/return-campus) website.

## Course description

This course covers issues related to the proper manner in which to develop and conduct a research project.
Statistical issues related to environmental evaluations will be discussed, including minimal detectable levels proper sample size, and determination of proper methods for evaluation of data, using both parametric and non-parametric procedures.

### Rationale

The ability to pose questions, plan research projects, and carry out data analyses it vital for environmental scientists at all levels.
Scientists need to analyze data in order to evaluate hypotheses and extract further insights from their observations.
Further, the ability to analyze data collected during fieldwork is a key component of effective science communication.
This course will provide students with these techniques.
Additionally, the methods of biostatistical analysis are applicable in all fields relating to science, whether they are applied directly when analyzing data or indirectly by providing a structure to interpret scientific findings.

### Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, you should know:

-   How to clean and prepare data for analyses.
-   How to perform exploratory data analysis.
-   How to evaluate data quality.
-   Methods to visualize patterns in data.
-   How to perform standard data analysis techniques, including linear regression, ANOVA, and generalized linear modeling.
-   How to identify the most appropriate analysis techniques to use with a given data set.
-   How to use knowledge of standard data analysis techniques to effectively choose and apply more advanced methods.

### MS Environemntal Science Learning Objectives

This course addresses the following MS Environmental Science program learning objectives:

-   Understand and critique the current state of knowledge on environmental issues and identify important knowledge gaps that need further investigation.
-   Understand the philosophy, rationale, and approach to using interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary themes and concepts in contemporary environmental science.
-   Practice and master implementation of the scientific method and the process of environmental project design, implementation, and communication.

## Grading policy

I will assess your achievement of the learning objectives based on your performance on the following assignments.

### Grading breakdown

-   Participation (10%)
-   Perusall readings (15%)
-   Weekly assignments (20%)
-   Data analysis reports (30%)
-   Individual analysis project (25%)

#### Participation

Your participation grade will include attendance (virtual or in-person), in-class assignments, class reflection 'quizes', etc..
Each item is worth 1 point, and I will be dropping the lowest 6 scores.
*If you are in-class, but distracted by things like texting, being on your computer when you don't need to be, not responding to break-out rooms (on Zoom), disrupting other students, etc., you will receive 0.5 points for attendance.*

#### Perusall readings

Most class related reading will be done using Perusall.
You should expect at least one Perusall assignment per week.
Your score will be based on your engagement with the assignment, as measured by the number of comments, questions, and comments *on* comments you make.

#### Weekly assignments

You will have fairly regular (i.e., weekly) assignments, which will be posted on Classes.
Assignments will vary, but generally assess whether you can execute key tasks in the R environment.

#### Data analysis reports

You will be given three data sets during the course of the semester, which you will need to use R to prepare a data analysis report.
A detailed rubric for these assignments will be provided.

#### Individual analysis project

During the course of the semester, you will carry out an independent research and analysis project, using the skills we learn in this class. The purpose of the analysis project is for you to gain independent applied research experience. You are expected to apply the data analysis skills we learn in class to a real-world data set (ideally one related to your thesis or capstone research interests). The project represents 25% of your grade, but is broken up into several components.

## Course Policies

### Syllabus Changes

Changes to the syllabus, including additional assignments, may be made at my discretion.
All changes will be announced during class.
Students are accountable for adhering to any announced changes.

### Attendance

Attendance is required for this course and part of your grade (see Participation above).
There is no set number of allowable excused or unexcused absences.
*If you are not feeling well, please stay home.* However, you should be aware that multiple absences are likely to affect your participation grade as well as your ability to complete assignments.
When possible, please let me know ahead of time when you will be absent, and we will work together to help you stay on trac

### Technology in the Classroom

Use of computers and tablets is necessary to complete many in-class assignments.
However, I expect you to be respectful and professional, and not to be "surfing the internet" during class.
If I witness this activity, you will lose class participation points.

### Classroom climate

Our Pace community benefits from the richly unique experiences and individual diversity each of us bring.
Intellectual growth and development happen when we engage in free and open discourse that challenges our own assumptions and beliefs.
Together we all have the responsibility to create and maintain an environment where differences are respected and valued.
To that end, we will challenge all manifestations of bias and discrimination to maintain a climate of mutual respect and civility.
Whether you are learning in an online or on campus environment, the same expectations of courtesy and conduct apply.
All classroom interactions should remain civil, respectful, and supportive.

### Plagiarism

Plagiarism, fabrication, or cheating will result in a failing grade for this course.
You may not use assignments in this class that you have written for other classes or for prior publication.
(Please also see the "Academic Integrity" section later in this syllabus.)
