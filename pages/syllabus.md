# ENS 623: Research and Statistical Methods

**Course Number:** ENS 623  
**Credits:** 3  
**Professors:** Dr. Michael Rubbo and Dr. Matthew Aiello-Lammens  
**Meeting day and time:** Wed 5:40 - 8:40 PM  
**Term:** Spring 2019  
**Location:** Environmental Center Classroom   

## Course description

This course covers issues related to the proper manner in which to develop and conduct a research project.
Statistical issues related to environmental evaluations will be discussed, including minimal detectable levels proper sample size, and determination of proper methods for evaluation of data, using both parametric and nonparametric procedures. 

## Rationale

The ability to pose questions, plan research projects, and carry out data analyses it vital for environmental scientists at all levels.
Scientists need to analyze data in order to evaluate hypotheses and extract further insights from their observations. 
Further, the ability to analyze data collected during fieldwork is a key component of effective science communication. 
This course will provide students with these techniques.
Additionally, the methods of biostatistical analysis are applicable in all fields relating to science, whether they are applied directly when analyzing data or indirectly by providing a structure to interpret scientific findings.


## Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, you should know:

* How to perform exploratory data analysis.
* How to evaluate data quality.
* Methods to visualize patterns in data.
* How to perform standard data analysis techniques, including linear regression, ANOVA, and generalized linear modeling.
* How to identify the most appropriate analysis techniques to use with a given dataset.
* How to use knowledge of standard data analysis techniques to effectively choose and apply more advanced methods.

## MS Environemntal Science Learning Objectives

This course addresses the following MS ES program learning objectives:

* Understand and critique the current state of knowledge on environmental issues and identify important knowledge gaps that need further investigation.
* Understand the philosophy, rationale, and approach to using interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary themes and concepts in contemporary environmental science.
* Practice and master implementation of the scientific method and the process of environmental project design, implementation, and communication.


## Assessment

We will assess your achievement of the learning objectives based on your performance on the following assignments. 
More information on each of these will be provided throughout the semester.

* Participation during in class assignments (10%)
* Draft MSES Appendix C and/or Appendix D, as appropriate for individual students (10%)
* Completed grant or RFP proposal (25%)
* Problem sets (25%)
* Analysis project (15%)
* Stats exam (15%)

Course Policies
---------------

### Attendance

Attendance and punctuality are required. Excused absences will be
considered, but must be discussed with your professors. Unexcused
absences and/or consistent lateness will negatively impact a student’s
final assessment and could result in failure.

### Technology in the Classroom

Use of computers and tablets may be necessary to complete some in-class
assignments. However, we expect you to respectful and professional, and
not to be “surfing the internet” during class. If we witness this
activity, you will not be allowed to use technology in the classroom
thereafter.

### Academic Integrity

All members of the Pace community are expected to behave with honesty
and integrity, as outlined in [Academic Integrity Code](http://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/files/student-handbook/pace-university-academic-integrity-code.pdf). The following
statement is from the Student Handbook:

> Students are required to be honest and ethical in satisfying their
> academic assignments and requirements. Academic integrity requires
> that, except as may be authorized by the instructor, a student must
> demonstrate independent intellectual and academic achievements.
> Therefore, when a student uses or relies upon an idea or material
> obtained from another source, proper credit or attribution must be
> given. A failure to give credit or attribution to ideas or material
> obtained from an outside source is plagiarism. Plagiarism is strictly
> forbidden. Every student is responsible for giving the proper credit
> or attribution for any quotation, idea, data, or other material
> obtained from another source that is presented (whether orally or in
> writing) in the student’s papers, reports, submissions, examinations,
> presentations and the like.
>
> Individual schools and programs may have adopted additional standards
> of academic integrity. Therefore, students are responsible for
> familiarizing themselves with the academic integrity policies of the
> University as well as of the individual schools and programs in which
> they are enrolled. A student who fails to comply with the standards of
> academic integrity is subject to disciplinary actions such as, but not
> limited to, a reduction in the grade for the assignment or the course,
> a failing grade in the assignment or the course, suspension and/or
> dismissal from the University.

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

The University’s commitment to equal educational opportunities for
students with disabilities includes providing reasonable accommodations
for the needs of students with disabilities. To request an accommodation
for a qualifying disability, a student must self-identify and register
with the Coordinator of Disability Services for his or her campus. No
one, including faculty, is authorized to evaluate the need and arrange
for an accommodation except the Coordinator of Disability Services.
Moreover, no one, including faculty, is authorized to contact the
Coordinator of Disability Services on behalf of a student. For further
information, please see Information for Students with Disabilities on
the University’s web site.\
To receive accommodation for any disability, students must contact the
campus Counseling Center (Pace Plaza, 212-346-1526; Westchester,
914-773-3710).
