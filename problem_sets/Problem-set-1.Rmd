**Please submit this homework as an R Markdown (Rmd) file.**

As I mentioned during our first meeting, rmarkdown is a way to incorporate text, with simple formatting, with R code chunks.
Rather than spell out how to create an Rmd file here, I recommend you consult the following resources:

* [RStudio Rmarkdown Quick Tour](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html)
* [RStudio Rmarkdown Intro Article](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html)
* [OurCodingClub Intro Example](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/24/rmarkdown-1.html)

#### Your file should use the following naming scheme

**`[last name]_ENS623_SP18_PS1.Rmd`**

For example, 

`Lammens_ENS623_SP18_PS1.Rmd`
