# Part 1

Using R's built-in `iris` dataset, calculate four different ANOVA models - one each for `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, `Petal.Length`, and `Petal.Width`.

# Part 2 

Choose one of the traits and calculate the elements of the ANOVA table "by hand". Show all of your work as R code.
(**Hint:** To complete this problem, calculate the results for the equations described in **Table 8.2 in Quinn and Keough**.)
