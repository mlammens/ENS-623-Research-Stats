**Please submit this homework as an R Markdown (Rmd) file.**
See the introduction to [Problem Set 1](http://mlammens.github.io/ENS-623-Research-Stats/problem_sets/Problem-set-1.html) if you need more information about the Rmd format.

#### File name

Your file should use the following naming scheme

**`[last name]_ENS623_SP18_PS7.Rmd`**

For example, 

`Lammens_ENS623_SP18_PS7.Rmd`

#### Grading note

Problem 1 is worth 10 points and problem 2 is worth 15 points.


# Problem 1

Generate 100 samples of $n = 10$ observations each from a standard normal distribution.
Calculate the mean and confidence interval for each sample. 
Plot each mean and confidence interval, using the `geom_errorbar` function in `ggplot2`.

Your final figure should look similar to that of Figure 4.8 on page 175 of the [OpenIntro Stats textbook](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os).

# Problem 2

Write a function in R that:

1. draws a sample ${X_1,X_2,â€¦,X_{n}}$ of size $n$ from the normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2 )$ (you are free to choose $\mu$ and $\sigma^2 \gt 0$), 
2. calculates the standard error of the mean, and 
3. calculates 

$$
\frac{ \bar{X} - \mu }{ s.e.mean }
$$

This function should have three inputs $(\mu,\sigma^2,n)$ and 
one output, the value of $\frac{ \bar{X} - \mu }{ s.e.mean }$

**NB:** See Logan pp. 34-35 for an explination of how to write your own function.

This function takes samples from the t-distribution!

Using your function, draw a large number (10,000 is probably fine, but you can play around with it) of samples from this distribution for $n = 5$, $n =50$, and $n =500$ observations. 
(Remember, $n$ is the number of draws from the normal distribution used to draw one sample from the t-distribution.) 
Plot these three histograms, preferably using `ggplot2` so that each histogram is on the same plot.
(You could also use the `hist` function with the option `add = T`, which will allow you to plot them all on the same plot).
