Problem Set 10: Linear Regression
========================================================

In this problem set, you will review the material on polynomial regression that we did not complete in class.
Review the [polynomial regression section](http://mlammens.github.io/ENS-623-Research-Stats/lectures/Lecture-11.html#linear-regression-with-quadratic-term-polynomial-regression) in the Meeting 11 notes.

## Questions 1

Looking over the diagnostic plots from the standard linear regression, what do you observe that might make you think this is not a good model fit?

## Question 2

Near the bottom of the section, the AIC values for multiple different models are calculated.
Based on these AIC values, which is the best fit model?

## Question 3

Based on the model you selected as the best fit model, provide a brief explination of what might be going on biologically speaking.
