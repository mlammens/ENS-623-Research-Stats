# 2016 PS 2

# DUE Monday February 22

# Part 1

Use the `iris` dataset that comes with R to answer the following questions.
We worked with this dataset in class during **Week 2**.
As a reminder, you can 'load' the `iris` dataset using the following command:

```
data(iris)
```

1. Calculate the **mean**, **standard deviation**, and an additional **measure of location** and **measuer of dispersion and variability** of your choosing for **Petal Length** for the full `iris` dataset **AND** for each species separately. 
In words, describe the differences you observe between species, and between individual species and the full dataset. 
Be sure to identify which measures of your choosing you are calculating. 
You may want to consult *Logan; Table 3.3* when deciding on additional measures.

2. Construct a **boxplot** for **Petal Length** using the `iris` dataset. 
Both the *Logan* and *Quinn & Keough* texts provide extensive information on boxplots.
You can use `base` R or `ggplot2`. 
See [this site](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_distributions_(ggplot2)/) for a good outline of constructing a boxplot with `ggplot2`.
In your plot, each box should represent a different species.
Describe each component of a generic boxplot, and describe why we might be interested in each value that is represented.

* **BONUS** Construct separate **density histograms** for **Petal Length** for each species. 
Overlay on top of the histograms curves for the **normal distributions** with the means and standard deviations calculated in (1) above. 
Hint 1: check out [this site](http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/probability.html) for information on plotting a normal distribution.
Hint 2: You can use `ggplot2` to overlay the normal onto your histogram, or in `base` R you can try adding `add = TRUE` to the `plot` function.

# Part 2

* Recall the M&Ms we worked with in Week 1. 
Using the same logic we used to derive the **binomial distribution**, derive the probability of obtaining a given combination of colors in our bag.
([Hint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution)). 
Calculate the probability of getting your specific bag (our data are [here](http://mlammens.github.io/Biostats/data/class_mm_data.csv))
