# Problem 1 - Emperical Probability Distributions

Using the data set you acquired for problem set 1 (or since), make a histogram of at least one of the columns of data. 
Plot your histogram so that it represents and **empircal probability distribution** (i.e., it should be a density plot). 
Describe in a couple of sentences, which probability distribution most likely best matches your data and why. 

# Problem 2 - Confidence Intervals

Calculate the mean, standard error, and 95% confidence intervals for at least one column of your data set. 
(**NOTE:** If your data set does not have a column that you can calculate these values for, you will need to work with a different data set for this problem.
Go back to Problem Set 1 to see suggestions on how to find other data sets.)

# Problem 3 - $t$ Distribution

Write a function in R that:

1. draws a sample ${X_1,X_2,â€¦,X_{n}}$ of size $n$ from the normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2 )$ (you are free to choose $\mu$ and $\sigma^2 \gt 0$), 
2. calculates the standard error of the mean, and 
3. calculates 

$$
\frac{ \bar{X} - \mu }{ s.e.mean }
$$

This function should have three inputs $(\mu,\sigma^2,n)$ and 
one output, the value of $\frac{ \bar{X} - \mu }{ s.e.mean }$

**NB:** See Logan pp. 34-35 for an explination of how to write your own function.

This function takes samples from the t-distribution!

Using your function, draw a large number (10,000 is probably fine, but you can play around with it) of samples from this distribution for $n = 5$, $n =50$, and $n =500$ observations. 
(Remember, $n$ is the number of draws from the normal distribution used to draw one sample from the t-distribution.) 
Plot these three histograms, preferably using `ggplot2` so that each histogram is on the same plot.
(You could also use the `hist` function with the option `add = T`, which will allow you to plot them all on the same plot).
