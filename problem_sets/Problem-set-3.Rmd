**Please submit this homework as an R Markdown (Rmd) file.**
See the introduction to [Problem Set 1](http://mlammens.github.io/ENS-623-Research-Stats/problem_sets/Problem-set-1.html) if you need more information about the Rmd format.

#### File name

Your file should use the following naming scheme

**`[last name]_ENS623_SP22_PS3.Rmd`**

For example, 

`Lammens_ENS623_SP22_PS3.Rmd`


## Problem 1 - creating a `myMean` function

Write a **function** named `myMean` that uses a `for` loop to calculate the mean of a vector of numbers.

Recall that the mean is:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}}{n}
$$

### Notes

* You should use the `for` loop to add up a vector of numbers.
* Create a vector of numbers to test your function on, and compare the results of your function with that of the `mean` function in base R.
