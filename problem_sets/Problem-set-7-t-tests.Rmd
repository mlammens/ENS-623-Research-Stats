# A comparison of metabolic rates of northern fulmars (sea-bird)

[Furness and Bryant (1996)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2265587) measured the metabolic rates of male and female breeding northern fulmars, and tested if there were any observable differences in these rates.

Get the data and have a look

```{r}
fulmars <- read.csv(file = "https://mlammens.github.io/ENS-623-Research-Stats/data/Logan_Examples/Chapter6/Data/furness.csv")
fulmars
summary(fulmars)
```

# Problem 1

Make a box plot showing a comparison of metabolic rate (`METRATE` in this data set) and the sex of northern fulmars.

# Problem 2

Calculate a *t* statistic, using the formulas presented in [Lecture 9](http://mlammens.github.io/ENS-623-Research-Stats/lectures/Lecture-9.html) and following the example related to fecundity of intertidal gastropods. 
Once you have the *t* statistic, calculate the probability that the samples of metabolic rates for male and female northern fulmars come from the same population. 

**Use this probability value to make a statement about whether you would accept or reject your null hypothesis.**

# Problem 3

Use the `t.test` function to verify that your answers for Problem 2 are correct. **Hint:** for this to work properly you will need to add the argument `var.equal = TRUE` to the `t.test` function call.

# Problem 4

Go back to Problem 1 and look at the box plots. 
You should notice that the variances (standard deviations) of the two groups are quite different from each other. This is a violation of one of the assumptions of the *t* test. 
One way to address this is to use the **Welch's *t* test**.
R will use Welch's *t* test by default if the variances are not equal, but you can make sure it does by setting `var.equal = FALSE`.

**Compare the results of Problem 3 and Problem 4. How do they differ?**
