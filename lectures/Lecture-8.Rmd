# Today's Goals

* Review the Central Limit Theorem
* Introduce principles of hypothesis testing

***

# Standard Normal distribution

Recall that last week we were introduced to the Normal (or Gaussian) Distribution with pdf:

$$
f(x|\mu,\sigma) \thicksim \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

The **Standard Normal** distribution is a **Normal** distribution with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$.


### Z-scores

As noted last class, we can convert from a normal distribution with any mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ to the standard normal by subtracting the mean from each value, then dividing by the standard deviation:

$$
z_i = \frac{y_i - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

The resulting values of this conversation are more commonly referred to as **Z-scores**.

**The z-score $z_i$ associated with the data point $y_i$ represents how many units of standard deviation $y_i$ is away from the mean of the distribution.**

# The Central Limit Theorem

## Sampling distribution of the mean

The frequency distribution of the **mean values** of several *different samples* taken from a population.

From Q&K p. 18:

> The probability distribution of means of samples from a normal distribution is also normally distributed.

## Using the CLT

From Q&K p. 18:

> The expected value or mean of the probability distribution of sample means equals the mean of the population ($\mu$) from which the samples were taken.


### Standard error of the sample mean

Last week we saw that **sample means are normally distributed**. 
What can we do with this?
To start, we can say something about the precision and accuracy of our estimates of the *population* mean based on the *sample* mean.

**Standard error of the mean** - the expected value of the standard deviation of the sample mean:

$$
\sigma_{\bar{y}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Often times we only have **one sample** from the population. What can we say then?

Standard error of the mean:

$$
s_{\bar{y}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

where $s$ is the sample estimate of the standard deviation of the original population and $n$ is the sample size.

**NB:** The standard error of the means "tells us about the error in using $\bar{y}$ to estimate $\mu$."


## Confidence intervals for the population mean

Recall that we can convert any observation from normal distribution to it's equivalent value from a standard normal distribution using:

$$
z_i = \frac{y_i - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

and that these are sometimes called ***z-scores***.

Using this formula, we can convert a sample mean, $\bar{y}$, into its corresponding value from a standard normal using:

$$
z = \frac{\bar{y} - \mu}{\sigma_{\bar{y}}}
$$

where the denominator is the standard error of the mean (see above). 

We can use this information to estimate how confident we are that are sample mean is a good representation of the *true* population mean.
Again, we are doing this by taking advantage of the fact that we know the sample means are *normally distributed*.
We calculate the range in which 95% of the sample mean values fall.

In mathematical terms, this looks like:

$$
P\{\bar{y} - 1.96\sigma_{\bar{y}} \leq \mu \leq \bar{y} + 1.96\sigma_{\bar{y}} \} = 0.95
$$

**VERY IMPORTANT:** The probability statement here is about the *interval*, not $\mu$. 
$\mu$ is not a random variable; it is fixed.
What we are saying is that there is 95% confidence that this interval includes the population mean, $\mu$.



### Unknown $\sigma$ (and $\sigma_{\bar{y}}$)

We rarely know $\sigma$, so we cannot calculate $\sigma_{\bar{y}}$. 
So what *can* we do?

Instead, we use the sample standard deviation, $s_{\bar{y}}$. 
So now we are dealing with a random variable that looks like: 

$$
\frac{\bar{y}-\mu}{s_{\bar{y}}}
$$

which is no longer standard normal distributed, but rather ***t* distributed**.

#### Challenge

Use whatever resource available to you, and look-up the ***t* distribution**.
What is/are the parameter(s) of the *t* distribution?


### Degrees of freedom

> The number of observations in our sample that are "free to vary" when we are estimating the variance (Q&K p.20; Box 2.1).

If I have calculated the mean, how many observations, out of a total of *n*, are free to vary?

**Answer:** $n-1$. Once I have the mean, I can use it and any $n-1$ values to calculate the *n*th value.

General rule regarding df's:

> the df is the number of observations minus the number of parameters included in the formula for the variance (Q&K p.20; Box 2.1).


## Standard error of other statistics

> The standard error is ... the standard deviation of the probability distribution of a specific statistics (Q&K p. 20).

### Standard error of the sample variance

The distribution of the sample variance is *not normal*. It is $\chi^2$ distributed.

Mathematically, this is explained as:

$$
X \thicksim N(0,1) \to X^2 \thicksim \chi^2
$$

Intuitively, why does this make sense?

# Hypothesis Testing

* What is a hypothesis? 
* How do we test our hypothesis?

The answers to these questions, with respect to this course, are primarily based on frequentest statistics.


## Example

Let's say we have a sample of observations that we want to know if they come from some population with a known value for $\mu$ (i.e., we know the population mean). 
We can see how (un)likely it is that the sample estimates come from this particular population, by looking at where these values fall in a *t* distribution. That is, calculate the *t* statistic:

$$
t_s = \frac{\bar{y} - \mu}{s_{\bar{y}}}
$$


## *t*-test

* Looking at differences between two samples of data. 
The *differences* should be *t* distributed.
* **Major assumptions** - the samples are drawn from populations that are:
    1. (Approximately) normally distributed
    2. Equally varied (i.e. equal variance)
    3. Each observation is *independent*
    
## We select the error rate

General Consensus is $p = 0.05$. This is known as Type-I error, or $\alpha$.

### Type-I versus Type-II error

* **Type-I error: $\alpha$** - our test suggests there is an effect, but there really is not one
* **Type-II error: $\beta$** - when you fail to detect an effect that really occurs

### Statistical power

The reciprocal of Type-II error ($\beta$) is **power**. 

$$
power(1-\beta) \propto \frac{ES \sqrt{n} \alpha}{\sigma}
$$

where $ES$ is *effect size*, $n$ is the sample size, $\alpha$ is the accepted Type I error rate, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

#### How do we increase statistical power?

Increase the sample size.

* Distribution of the mean becomes narrower
* Acceptance region becomes narrower
* Curves overlap less
* Type II error rate becomes smaller

## What are the general steps to hypothesis testing?

See p. 33-34 in Q&K. Fisher's approach below:

* Construct null hypothesis ($H_0$)
* Choose a test stat that measures deviation from null
* Collect data and compare the value of the test stat to the known distribution of that stat.
* Determine p-val
* Accept or reject null

What are some of the potential problems with this approach?

### Our data or something more extreme

When we use a sampling distribution for our test statistic (e.g., the *t* distribution), we are asking "what is the probability of observing our data, or something more extreme, in the long run, if $H_0$ is true."
Mathematically, this can be written as:

$$
P(data|H_0)
$$

## Examples of parametric hypothesis testing

Below is the generic form of the *t* statistic:

$$
t_s = \frac{St - \theta}{S_{St}}
$$

where $St$ is the value of some statistic (e.g., the mean) from our **sample**, $\theta$ is the **population** value for that statistic, and $S_{St}$ is the estimated standard error of the statistic $St$ (based on our sample).

How can we use this formula to test whether two samples are drawn from the same population?

Imagine the case where we have two different samples, and for each we're testing whether the means are different from the population means.
We then have:

$$
t_1 = \frac{\bar{y_1}-\mu_1}{s_{\bar{y}_1}}
$$

and

$$
t_2 = \frac{\bar{y_2}-\mu_2}{s_{\bar{y}_2}}
$$

If the two samples are drawn from the same population, then $\mu_1 = \mu_2$, or $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$.

We can then write our *t* stat as:

$$
t = \frac{(\bar{y_1} - \bar{y_2}) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{s_{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2}}
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{y_1} - \bar{y_2}}{s_{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2}}
$$

where $s_{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2}$ is the standard error of the difference between the means and is equal to:

$$
s_{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2} = 
\sqrt{
\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 -2}
(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})
}
$$


### Differences in fecundity of intertidal gastropods in two different intertidal zones (Example 6A in Logan, Box 3.1 in Q&K)

Ward and Quinn (1988) investigated the differences in fecundity of *Lepsiella vinosa* in two different intertidal zones (mussel zone and littorinid zone). 

Get the data and have a quick look

```{r}
gastro <- read.csv(file = "https://mlammens.github.io/ENS-623-Research-Stats/data/Logan_Examples/Chapter6/Data/ward.csv")
summary(gastro)
```

Make a box plot to help assess differences in variance and deviations from normality.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(data = gastro, aes(x = ZONE, y = EGGS)) +
  theme_bw()

```

Calculate means and standard deviations of each group separately. We will be using `dplyr` for this.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

gastro %>%
  group_by(ZONE) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(EGGS), Var = var(EGGS))

```


Run *t* test.

```{r}
(gastro_t_test <- t.test(data = gastro, EGGS ~ ZONE, var.equal = TRUE))

gastro_t_test$estimate[1] - gastro_t_test$estimate[2]

```


### Metabolic rates of northern fulmars (sea-bird)

Furness and Bryant (1996) measured the metabolic rates of male and female breeding northern fulmars, and tested if there were any observable differences in these rates.

Get the data and have a look

```{r}
fulmars <- read.csv(file = "https://mlammens.github.io/ENS-623-Research-Stats/data/Logan_Examples/Chapter6/Data/furness.csv")
fulmars
summary(fulmars)
```

Make a box plot to help assess differences in variance and deviations from normality.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(data = fulmars, aes(x = SEX, y = METRATE)) +
  theme_bw()

```

#### Challenge

Are the variances the same?

Calculate means and standard deviations of each group separately. We will be using `dplyr` for this.

```{r}
fulmars %>%
  group_by(SEX) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(METRATE), Var = var(METRATE))

```

Based on inequality of variances, use Welch's *t*-test.

```{r}
(fulmars_t_test <- t.test(data = fulmars, METRATE ~ SEX, var.equal = FALSE))
```
