#### Major Challenge

Generate 100 samples from a standard normal distribution of 10 observations each.
Calculate the mean and confidence interval for each. 
Plot each mean and confidence interval, using the `geom_errorbar` function in `ggplot2`.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Set the number of samples
n_samples <- 100

# Set the number of observations for each sample set
n_obs <- 10

# Create a vector of means for each of the n_samples observations
n_samples_means <- c()
n_samples_vars <- c()

for (int in 1:n_samples){
  # draw observations from a standard normal (note, these could also be called samples)
  obs <- rnorm(n_obs)
  
  # calculate the mean of the observations
  obs_mean <-mean(obs)
  
  # add these means to the vector of means
  n_samples_means <- c(n_samples_means, obs_mean)
  
  # calculate the variances of the observations
  obs_vars <- var(obs)
  
  # add these to the vector of variances
  n_samples_vars <- c(n_samples_vars, obs_vars)
  
}

se_df <- data.frame(means = n_samples_means, vars = n_samples_vars, n = n_obs)

se_df$se_upper <- se_df$means + (1.96*se_df$vars)
se_df$se_lower <- se_df$means - (1.96*se_df$vars)

ggplot(data = se_df) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = se_lower, xmax = se_upper, x = means, y = 1:nrow(se_df))) +
  geom_point(aes(x = means, y = 1:nrow(se_df), colour = "red")) +
  coord_flip()

```
